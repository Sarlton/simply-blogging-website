          <h2>The future of tertiary digital education in South Africa</h2>
          <h5>
            It has become clear that the education sector will not return to
            what it was before COVID, but digital learning will only succeed if
            chronic societal problems are dealt with., May 07, 2021
          </h5>

          <p>
            The entire spectrum of education, from grade school right up to
            tertiary education, was severely impacted by the COVID-driven
            lockdowns that hit the sector like a tidal wave in 2020. Schools,
            universities and colleges were forced, within weeks, to transform
            from predominantly classroom-based teaching to remote,
            Internet-based methods. For most institutions, this became a mad
            scramble to maintain the momentum of teaching and learning. Success
            rates varied widely.

            This year’s Africa Tech Week Conference will be held virtually on 5
            and 6 May 2021. Africa Tech Week is a leading conference, exhibition
            and award summit for technology professionals who believe that true
            digital transformation across the continent requires co-operation
            between business leaders, governments and civil society. Africa Teen
            Geeks is proud to announce that CEO, Lindiwe Matlali, will be one of
            the key speakers at the 2021 Africa Tech Week Summit, alongside
            Thomas Davin, UNICEF’S Global Innovation Director; Dr Marian Croak,
            VP of Engineering at Google; and Namibia’s Deputy Minister of ICT
            Hon Emma Theofelus. The Africa Tech Week Summit promotes digital
            transformation across Africa and the globe by connecting government,
            corporate business leaders and strong figureheads within the tech
            industry.
